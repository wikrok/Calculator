Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,098 out of   1,430   76%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,632 out of   2,860   57%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,773
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,968 out of   3,773   78%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             185 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
